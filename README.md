SynapticSnap: A Neural Network with Biologically Inspired Synaptic Plasticity

This project explores the concept of "snapping" synapses in a simple neural network built with Python and NumPy. It demonstrates how a dynamic, decaying learning rate can mimic the rapid initial learning and subsequent stabilization of synaptic connections observed in the brain.
Key Concepts
The core idea of this project is to simulate a more biologically plausible learning process. In traditional neural networks, the learning rate is often a constant. Here, we introduce a dynamic learning rate that is high at the beginning of training and gradually decreases. This results in:
Rapid Initial Learning: Large adjustments to the synaptic weights are made at the start, allowing the network to quickly find a general solution.
Fine-Tuning and Stabilization: As the learning rate decays, the weight adjustments become smaller, allowing the network to fine-tune its parameters and stabilize, preventing it from overshooting the optimal solution.
How It Works
The "snapping" effect is achieved through a simple learning rate decay formula:
learning_rate = initial_learning_rate / (1 + decay_rate * iteration)
This formula is applied at each training iteration to adjust the magnitude of the weight updates. The Python script snapping_synapse_nn.py implements a simple neural network that utilizes this technique.
Getting Started
To run this project yourself, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
code

python snapping_synapse_nn.py
Results and Visualizations
The script will generate the following plots, which clearly demonstrate the "snapping" behavior of the synapses:
Learning Rate Decay
This plot shows how the learning rate decreases over the training iterations, starting high and gradually leveling off.

Synaptic Weight Changes
This plot visualizes the evolution of the synaptic weights. You can observe the large, rapid changes at the beginning of training, followed by a period of stabilization as they converge towards their optimal values.

Future Work
This project serves as a foundational exploration of dynamic synapses. Future directions could include:
Implementing more complex learning rate schedules: Explore exponential decay or step decay.
Exploring Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs): For a more biologically realistic model, implement this concept using libraries like snnTorch or Brian2.
Applying the model to more complex datasets: Test the performance of this learning method on datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10.
